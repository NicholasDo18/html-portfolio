<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a computer science student with a strong passion for becoming a full-stack engineer. I'm currently honing my skills in Java, Python, DSA, and web development, including CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and SQL. Iâ€™m actively working on personal projects to build my portfolio and aiming to secure a summer 2025 software internship. Alongside my studies, I stay committed to personal growth through regular gym workouts, habit tracking, and maintaining a balanced lifestyle.</p>
